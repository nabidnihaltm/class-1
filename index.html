    A gate near Nasirabad Cantonment in Chittagong, Bangladesh, is known as the <strong>"Shrine of Bayazid Bostami" </strong> . But there is no history of any historical figure named Bayezid Bostami coming to Bangladesh. In Chittagong, the mausoleum known by its name is just a portrait or a symbol. However, many people believe that Bayazid Bostami arrived in Bangladesh. Towards the eighth century AD, Arab merchants used to visit the Chittagong coast. So, it is not impossible for Bayazid Bostami's arrival in Chittagong in the ninth century. But it's just an idea. No clear evidence has been found so far.   <br>
